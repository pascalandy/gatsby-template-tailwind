This **CHANGELOG** should make it easy for you to see what is happening with this project. Each release automatically generates/formats/updates this changeling thanks to [BashLaVa](https://github.com/firepress-org/bashlava). It uses the same « Agile Deployment Lifecycle » we use at FirePress. See our [blog post](https://firepress.org/en/how-do-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/) about it. It follows the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) spirit and adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
